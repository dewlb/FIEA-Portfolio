One document of code
The file I submitted as my one example piece of code I will also attach here, being:

While this example isn't the most logically demanding thing I have written, it is in the requested C# language, was a script I wrote for a Unity game I created during my time at UCF, and I feel best shows my typical coding practices and organization.

The file listed above was part of a game created by a group. I mainly worked on a lot of the logic in terms of scene progression and pickups. Switching between scenes, coding itme pickups to trigger events, and giving properties to pickups. One of the properties I was most proud of was adding a proximity dull noise to the hidden objects and a highlight when hovered over to better steer the player to the pickups.
