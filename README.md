# FIEA-Portfolio
Portfolio for my application to Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
All code I am the original author of.

The file I am submitting as an example piece of code is: <br>
[KeyPickup.cs](KeyPickup.cs)

While this example isn't the most logically demanding thing I have written, it is in the requested C# language, was a script I wrote for a Unity game I created during my time at UCF, and I feel best shows my typical coding practices and organization.

The file listed above was part of a game created by a group. I mainly worked on a lot of the logic in terms of scene progression and pickups. This included but was not limited to switching between scenes, coding item pickups to trigger events, and giving properties to pickups. One of the aspects I was most proud of was adding a proximity dull noise to the hidden objects and a highlight when hovered over to better steer the player to the pickups. As you approached an object, the noise would gradually get louder. The full prototype if you would like to check it out is contained at the link: <br> [ShadowsOfYesterday](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1He66T4sjSy9rd3OYrpTI9uPjA8kldC92?usp=drive_link)

For easier review, I also have a video demo I created and our final powerpoint. I voiced over both of these, and they can be found at: <br>

Another game I worked on was more conceptual. Our team was tasked only with creating a full game design document, but for proof of concept and prototyping, I volunteered to create a very basic version just to outline mechanics. It was done on a tight timeline of about a week and I am not very artistic so a lot of assets were ones I found for free in Unity market. This basic prototype can be found at the following link: <br> [BroughtToLight](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Rf_akZyOLsHcVOpzLMyedUFCqeIF-PZ?usp=sharing)

The remaining files are all documents that I felt were relevant, whether it just is code organization or style, or functionality. The matching game was early in my career but something I am still proud of. Thank you for taking the time to look through my work! I am very passionate about what I do and I hope that comes through.

**Matching Game** - created my own two card matching game in python. Not owner of visual assets but everything else I made from scratch. For quick code review, [Main Python File](MatchingGame/matchinggame.py) <br>
[Game.java](Game.java) - simulated "chess-like" game algorithm such that user wins every time. Example of code formatting and solving complex algorithms. <br>
[GameManager.cs](GameManager.cs) - game manager for Shadows of Yesterday. Keeps track of collected items and loads the next scene. <br>
