# FIEA-Portfolio
Portfolio for my application to Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy.

One document of code
The file I submitted as my one example piece of code I will also attach here, being:
**KeyPickup.cs**
While this example isn't the most logically demanding thing I have written, it is in the requested C# language, was a script I wrote for a Unity game I created during my time at UCF, and I feel best shows my typical coding practices and organization.

The file listed above was part of a game created by a group. I mainly worked on a lot of the logic in terms of scene progression and pickups. Switching between scenes, coding itme pickups to trigger events, and giving properties to pickups. One of the properties I was most proud of was adding a proximity dull noise to the hidden objects and a highlight when hovered over to better steer the player to the pickups. The full prototype if you would like to check it out is contained at the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1He66T4sjSy9rd3OYrpTI9uPjA8kldC92?usp=drive_link

Another game I worked on was more conceptual. Our team was tasked only with creating a full game design document, but for proof of concept and prototyping, I volunteered to create a very basic version just to outline mechanics. It was done on a tight timeline of about a week and I am not very artistic so a lot of assets were ones I found for free in Unity market. This basic prototype can be found at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Rf_akZyOLsHcVOpzLMyedUFCqeIF-PZ?usp=sharing
